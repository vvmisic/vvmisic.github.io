  <p><b>Abstract:</b></p> 
  <p> Customer behavior is often assumed to follow weak rationality, which implies that adding a product to an assortment will not increase the choice probability of another product in that assortment. However, an increasing amount of research has revealed that customers are not necessarily rational when making decisions. In this paper, we study a new nonparametric choice model that relaxes this assumption and can model a wider range of customer behavior, such as decoy effects between products. In this model, each customer type is associated with a binary decision tree, which represents a decision process for making a purchase based on checking for the existence of specific products in the assortment. Together with a probability distribution over customer types, we show that the resulting model -- a <i>decision forest</i> -- is able to represent <i>any</i> customer choice model, including models that are inconsistent with weak rationality. We theoretically characterize the depth of the forest needed to fit a data set of historical assortments and prove that asymptotically, a forest whose depth scales logarithmically in the number of assortments is sufficient to fit most data sets. We also propose an efficient algorithm for estimating such models from data, based on combining randomization and optimization. Using synthetic data and real transaction data exhibiting non-rational behavior, we show that the model outperforms the multinomial logit and ranking-based models in out-of-sample predictive ability.

  <p><b>Abstract:</b></p> 
  <p> Optimal stopping is the problem of deciding when to stop a stochastic system to obtain the greatest reward, arising in numerous application areas such as finance, healthcare and marketing. State-of-the-art methods for high-dimensional optimal stopping involve approximating the value function or the continuation value, and then using that approximation within a greedy policy. Although such policies can perform very well, they are generally not guaranteed to be interpretable; that is, a decision maker may not be able to easily see the link between the current system state and the policy’s action. In this paper, we propose a new approach to optimal stopping, wherein the policy is represented as a binary tree, in the spirit of naturally interpretable tree models commonly used in machine learning. We formulate the problem of learning such policies from observed trajectories of the stochastic system as a sample average approximation (SAA) problem. We prove that the SAA problem converges under mild conditions as the sample size increases, but that computationally even immediate simplifications of the SAA problem are theoretically intractable. We thus propose a tractable heuristic for approximately solving the SAA problem, by greedily constructing the tree from the top down. We demonstrate the value of our approach by applying it to the canonical problem of option pricing, using both synthetic instances and instances calibrated with real S&P500 data. Our method obtains policies that (1) outperform state-of-the-art non-interpretable methods, based on simulation-regression and martingale duality, and (2) possess a remarkably simple and intuitive structure.

  <p><b>Abstract:</b></p> 
  <p> <b>Objective</b>: Develop a model for predicting preventable and unplanned readmissions in surgical patients with high accuracy using demographic and surgical data.</p>

<p><b>Background</b>: Readmissions are costly. Although the prediction of readmissions has been studied in non-surgical patients, it has received relatively little attention in surgical patient populations. In addition, while most prior research speaks to the predictive accuracy that is attainable in different patient populations and using different types of data, there has been less attention devoted to quantifying the operational benefit of such predictive models. </p>

<p><b>Methods</b>: Using a cohort of surgical patients admitted between 2013 and 2016 at the UCLA Ronald Reagan Medical Center, we evaluate the out-of-sample accuracy of different machine learning models for predicting unplanned and preventable readmissions. We define an unplanned readmission as one that enters the hospital through the emergency room, while a preventable readmission is one that has at least one DRG code and does not involve any time in the ICU at readmission. We also consider operational metrics that quantify the value of our models in making post-discharge monitoring and intervention decisions. </p>

<p><b>Results</b>: Our most accurate models achieve out-of-sample area-under-the-curve (AUC) values in the 0.8 - 0.9 range, indicating excellent predictive accuracy. This accuracy is maintained when the models are used to make predictions shortly after surgery, indicating the potential of our model to inform interventions before discharge. General surgical and demographic information and lab data (e.g., blood glucose) have the most predictive value, with medication data and team data having minimal contribution to the predictive accuracy of our models. Our models translate to meaningful monitoring decisions: targeting the highest risk patients according to our models leads to correctly anticipating up to ten times as many readmissions as a naive selection method that targets patients at random and up to three times as many readmissions as a state-of-the-art risk prediction model.</p>

<p><b>Conclusions</b>: Using general surgical and lab data that is available prior to discharge, one can obtain highly accurate models for predicting a large class of unplanned and actionable readmissions.</p></div> -->

          <p>Tree ensemble models such as random forests and boosted trees are among the most widely used and practically successful predictive models in applied machine learning and business analytics. Although such models have been used to make predictions based on exogenous, uncontrollable independent variables, they are increasingly being used to make predictions where the independent variables are controllable and are also decision variables. In this paper, we study the problem of tree ensemble optimization: given a tree ensemble that predicts some dependent variable using controllable independent variables, how should we set these variables so as to maximize the predicted value? We formulate the problem as a mixed-integer optimization problem. We theoretically examine the strength of our formulation, provide a hierarchy of approximate formulations with bounds on approximation quality and exploit the structure of the problem to develop two large-scale solution methods, one based on Benders decomposition and one based on iteratively generating tree split constraints. We test our methodology on real data sets, including two case studies in drug design and customized pricing, and show that our methodology can efficiently solve large-scale instances to near or full optimality, and outperforms solutions obtained by heuristic approaches. In our drug design case, we show how our approach can identify compounds that efficiently trade-off predicted performance and novelty with respect to existing, known compounds. In our customized pricing case, we show how our approach can efficiently determine optimal store-level prices under a random forest model that delivers excellent predictive accuracy.

          <p> Research in operations management has traditionally focused on models for understanding, mostly at a strategic level, how firms should operate. Spurred by the growing availability of data and recent advances in machine learning and optimization methodologies, there has been an increasing application of data analytics to problems in operations management. In this paper, we review recent applications of data analytics to operations management, in three major areas -- supply chain management, revenue management and healthcare operations -- and highlight some exciting directions for the future.

  <p><b>Abstract:</b></p> 
  <p> A fundamental problem faced by firms is that of product line design: given a set of candidate products that may be offered to a collection of customers, what subset of those products should be offered so as to maximize the profit that is realized when customers make purchases according to their preferences? In this paper, we consider the product line design problem when customers choose according to a first-choice rule and present a new mixed-integer optimization formulation of the problem. We theoretically analyze the strength of our formulation and show that it is stronger than alternative formulations that have been proposed in the literature, thus contributing to a unified understanding of the different formulations for this problem. We also present a novel solution approach for solving our formulation at scale, based on Benders decomposition, which exploits the surprising fact that Benders cuts for both the relaxation and the integer problem can be generated in a computationally efficient manner. We demonstrate the value of our formulation and Benders decomposition approach through two sets of experiments. In the first, we use synthetic instances to show that our formulation is computationally tractable and can be solved an order of magnitude faster for small to medium scale instances than the alternate, previously proposed formulations. In the second, we consider a previously studied product line design instance based on a real conjoint data set, involving over 3000 candidate products and over 300 respondents. We show that this problem, which required a week of computation time to solve in prior work, is solved by our approach to full optimality in approximately ten minutes.

<p><b>Abstract:</b></p> 
<p>The United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) is responsible for planning and executing the transportation of United States military personnel and cargo by air, land and sea. The airlift planning problem faced by the air component of USTRANSCOM is to decide how requirements (passengers and cargo) will be assigned to the available aircraft fleet and the sequence of pickups and dropoffs that each aircraft will perform in order to ensure that the requirements are delivered with minimal delay and with maximum utilization of the available aircraft. This problem is of significant interest to USTRANSCOM due to the highly time-sensitive nature of the requirements that are typically designated for delivery by airlift, as well as the very high cost of airlift operations. At the same time, the airlift planning problem is extremely difficult to solve due to the combinatorial nature of the problem and the numerous constraints present in the problem (such as weight restrictions and crew rest requirements). In this paper, we propose an approach for solving the airlift planning problem faced by USTRANSCOM based on modern, large-scale optimization. Our approach relies on solving a large-scale mixed-integer programming model that disentangles the assignment decision (which aircraft will pickup and deliver which requirement) from the sequencing decision (in what order the aircraft will pickup and deliver its assigned requirements), using a combination of heuristics and column generation. Through computational experiments with both a simulated data set and a planning data set provided by USTRANSCOM, we show that our approach leads to high-quality solutions for realistic instances (e.g., 100 aircraft and 100 requirements) within operationally feasible time frames. Compared to a baseline approach that emulates current practice at USTRANSCOM, our approach leads to reductions in total delay and aircraft time of 8 to 12% in simulated data instances and 16 to 40% in USTRANSCOM's planning instances.

<p><b>Abstract:</b></p> 
<p> Dynamic resource allocation (DRA) problems constitute an important class of dynamic stochastic optimization problems that arise in a variety of important real-world applications. DRA problems are notoriously difficult to solve to optimality since they frequently combine stochastic elements with intractably large state and action spaces. Although the artificial intelligence and operations research communities have independently proposed two successful frameworks for solving dynamic stochastic optimization problems---Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) and rolling horizon optimization (RHO), respectively---the relative merits of these two approaches are not well understood. In this paper, we adapt both MCTS and RHO to two problems -- a problem inspired by tactical wildfire management and a classical problem involving the control of queueing networks -- and undertake an extensive computational study comparing the two methods on large scale instances of both problems in terms of both the state and the action spaces. We show that both methods are able to greatly improve on a baseline, problem-specific heuristic. On smaller instances, the MCTS and RHO approaches perform comparably, but the RHO approach outperforms MCTS as the size of the problem increases for a fixed computational budget.

<p><b>Abstract:</b></p> 
<p> The majority of approaches to product line design that have been proposed by marketing scientists assume that the underlying choice model that describes how the customer population will respond to a new product line is known precisely. In reality, however, marketers do not precisely know how the customer population will respond and can only obtain an estimate of the choice model from limited conjoint data. In this paper, we propose a new type of optimization approach for product line design under uncertainty. Our approach is based on the paradigm of robust optimization where, rather than optimizing the expected revenue with respect to a single model, one optimizes the worst-case expected revenue with respect to an uncertainty set of models. This framework allows us to account for both parameter uncertainty, when we may be confident about the type of model structure but not about the values of the parameters, and structural uncertainty, when we may not even be confident about the right model structure to use to describe the customer population. Through computational experiments with a real conjoint data set, we demonstrate the benefits of our approach in addressing parameter and structural uncertainty. With regard to parameter uncertainty, we show that product lines designed without accounting for parameter uncertainty are fragile and can experience worst-case revenue losses as high as 23%, and that the robust product line can significantly outperform the nominal product line in the worst-case, with relative improvements of up to 14%. With regard to structural uncertainty, we similarly show that product lines that are designed for a single model structure can be highly suboptimal under other structures (worst-case losses of up to 37%), while a product line that optimizes against the worst of a set of structurally distinct models can outperform single-model product lines by as much as 55% in the worst-case and can guarantee good aggregate performance over structurally distinct models.

<p><b>Abstract:</b></p> 
<p> Decomposable Markov decision processes (MDPs) are problems where the stochastic system can be decomposed into multiple individual components. Although such MDPs arise naturally in many practical applications, they are often difficult to solve exactly due to the enormous size of the state space of the complete system, which grows exponentially with the number of components. In this paper, we propose an approximate solution approach to decomposable MDPs that is based on re-solving a fluid linear optimization formulation of the problem at each decision epoch. This formulation tractably approximates the problem by modeling transition behavior at the level of the individual components rather than the complete system. We prove that our fluid formulation provides a tighter bound on the optimal value function than three state-of-the-art formulations: the approximate linear optimization formulation, the classical Lagrangian relaxation formulation and a novel, alternate Lagrangian relaxation that is based on relaxing an action consistency constraint. We provide a numerical demonstration of the effectiveness of the approach in the area of multiarmed bandit problems, where we show that our approach provides near optimal performance and outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms.

<p><b>Abstract:</b></p> 
<p>We consider adaptive robust methods for lung cancer that are also dose-reactive, wherein the treatment is modified after each treatment session to account for the dose delivered in prior treatment sessions. Such methods are of interest because they potentially allow for errors in the delivered dose to be corrected as the treatment progresses, thereby ensuring that the tumor receives a sufficient dose at the end of the treatment. We show through a computational study with real lung cancer patient data that while dose reaction is beneficial with respect to the final dose distribution, it may lead to exaggerated daily underdose and overdose relative to non-reactive methods that grows as the treatment progresses. However, by combining dose reaction with a mechanism for updating an estimate of the uncertainty, the magnitude of this growth can be mitigated substantially. The key finding of this paper is that reacting to dose errors -- an adaptation strategy that is both simple and intuitively appealing -- may backfire and lead to treatments that are clinically unacceptable.

<p><b>Abstract:</b></p> 
<p>A previous approach to robust intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) treatment planning for moving tumors in the lung involves solving a single planning problem before the start of treatment and using the resulting solution in all of the subsequent treatment sessions. In this paper, we develop an adaptive robust optimization approach to IMRT treatment planning for lung cancer, where information gathered in prior treatment sessions is used to update the uncertainty set and guide the reoptimization of the treatment for the next session. Such an approach allows for the estimate of the uncertain effect to improve as the treatment goes on. Our method is computationally tractable, as it involves solving a sequence of linear optimization problems. We present computational results for a lung cancer patient case and show that using our adaptive robust method, it is possible to attain a significant improvement over the traditional robust approach in both tumor coverage and organ sparing simultaneously. We also prove that under certain conditions our adaptive robust method is asymptotically optimal, which provides insight into the performance observed in our computational study. The essence of our method -- solving a sequence of single-stage robust optimization problems, with the uncertainty set updated each time -- can potentially be applied to other problems that involve multi-stage decisions to be made under uncertainty.

<p><b>Abstract:</b></p> 
<p>The fluence map optimization (FMO) problem is a core problem in intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) treatment planning. Although it has been studied extensively for site-specific treatment planning, few studies have examined efficient computational methods for solving it for intensity modulated total marrow irradiation (IM-TMI) planning; few studies have also looked at exploiting prior beamlet information to solve the FMO problem in a beam orientation optimization context. In this study, we consider different types of line search strategies and different types of warm-start techniques to improve the speed with which the FMO problem for IM-TMI is solved and the quality of the end solution. We also consider a parallelism-enhanced algorithm to solve the FMO problem for IM-TMI treatment planning with a large number of beams (36 equispaced beams at each of 11 isocenters, for a total of 396 beams). We show that the backtracking line search strategy with step reduction exhibits the best performance and that using either of the two types of warm-start techniques which we consider leads to significant improvements in both solution time and quality. We also provide results for the aforementioned 396-beam plan and show that 30-beam solutions obtained using beam orientation optimization attain a comparable level of quality as this larger solution.

<p><b>Abstract:</b></p> 
<p>We consider the beam orientation optimization (BOO) problem for total marrow irradiation (TMI) treatment planning using intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Currently, IMRT is not widely used in TMI treatment delivery; furthermore, the effect of using non-coplanar beam orientations is not known. We propose and implement several variations of a single neighborhood search algorithm that solves the BOO problem effectively when gantry angles and couch translations are considered. Our work shows that the BOO problem for TMI cases can be solved in a clinically acceptable amount of time and leads to treatment plans that are more effective than the conventional approach to TMI.

          <p><b>Abstract:</b></p>
          <p>Taxation of incomes obtained by individuals in a society yields revenues that a government can reinvest for the benefit of the public, and an important question in political economy is how different types of taxation impact the overall wealth and the inequality of society. In this paper, we consider this question from a behavioral decision theory perspective, by developing a stylized model of a society where agents invest effort to increase their wealth under taxation and where their effort/production decisions are affected by inequality aversion with respect to the (after-tax) wealth positions of other agents. We present simulation results that engender several interesting insights, in particular: (1) envy is beneficial with regard to decreasing inequality and increasing wealth growth, (2) guilt leads to less inequality, but at the price of reduced wealth growth and (3) under every regime of inequality aversion, higher taxes lead to improved equality up to a point, at which higher taxes worsen inequality. We additionally propose an experiment that mimics the model and could be used to verify the phenomena observed in our simulation study, as well as some of its underlying assumptions. From a broader perspective, our paper presents a step in using behavioral decision theory to address a fundamental policy problem that could inspire other interesting applications in this domain.</p>

<p><b>Abstract:</b></p> 
<p>Music constitutes a highly developed industry, with global revenue valued at $16 billion in 2012. At the core of the music industry are the artists, who are responsible for physically creating the music. However, it is the record labels that provide artists with the necessary resources to distribute and sell their music on a large scale. After signing an artist a record label incurs numerous costs, such as those associated with studio recording, marketing, distribution and touring, in exchange for a percentage of the profits from sales of albums, singles and concert tickets. Unfortunately, the success of an artist’s release is highly uncertain: a single by one artist may be extremely popular, resulting in widespread radio play and many digital downloads, while another single turns out to be highly unpopular and as a result unprofitable. Therefore, record labels face the fundamental decision problem of which musical releases by which artists to support for the highest chance of financial success.</p>
<p>In this project, we consider the problem of predicting the popularity of a song using information about its properties. More precisely, we study the challenge of predicting whether a song will reach a spot in the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100 chart, using physical attributes such as its duration, tempo, and overall time signature. Our approach is driven by three distinct data sources. We first use data obtained from the Billboard Hot 100 chart, which ranks the popularity of currently released songs that are publicly available in the United States. The chart ranking is primarily based on the number of both physical and digital sales of the song, as well as on the number of times the song has been played on radio stations. We then utilize data obtained from Wikipedia to form a corpus of songs outside of the top ten hits of the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Finally, we use data from The Echo Nest, which is a music intelligence platform that provides high level metrics for a given song (such as estimated tempo and estimated time signature), as well as more detailed statistics (such the amount of power at different pitches during various time points in the song).</p>
<p>We built a data set consisting of the top ten songs on the Hot 100 chart from 1990 to 2013, as well as a random subsample of songs released between 1990 and 2012 (as identified by Wikipedia). For each song we acquired 94 different descriptive variables through The Echo Nest, and then tested three distinct classification approaches: logistic regression, classification and regression trees, and random forests. After building each type of model on a training set, we tested the accuracy of the models on a separate test set. All three models resulted in a comparable level of accuracy that improved upon the baseline accuracy by just over 1% (85.5% versus 84.2%). However, upon computing the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the curve (AUC) metric for our logistic regression model, we obtained an AUC of 80%, which is well over the 50% accuracy of purely random guessing. Intuitively, this indicates that the logistic regression correctly differentiates between a top 10 hit and a regular song in four out of five trials. Furthermore, based on the significance levels of the variables emerging from the logistic regression, the most important predictive factors include the rhythmic “clarity” of a song, its loudness, and a number of statistics related to the prevalence of certain musical notes and certain timbres/sonic textures. </p>
<p>Our data set also yields other interesting statistical insights. We divided the dataset into five year periods and considered the same prediction problem constrained to each of these individual intervals. Within these smaller prediction problems, we find that the difference between the three prediction methods and the baseline method is more pronounced than for the prediction problem with the entire 23-year data set. In addition to this, we find that random forests tend to noticeably outperform the other methods. As an example of these results, in the 2010-2013 period we find that random forests and logistic regression result in accuracies of 80.5% and 80.0%, respectively, while the baseline method results in an accuracy of 74.4%.

<p><b>Abstract:</b></p> 
<p>A previous approach to robust intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) treatment planning for moving tumours in the lung involves solving a single planning problem before treatment and using the resulting solution in all of the subsequent treatment sessions. In this thesis, we develop two adaptive robust IMRT optimization approaches for lung cancer, which involve using information gathered in prior treatment sessions to guide the reoptimization of the treatment for the next session. The first method is based on updating an estimate of the uncertain effect, while the second is based on additionally updating the dose requirements to account for prior errors in dose. We present computational results using real patient data for both methods and an asymptotic analysis for the first method. Through these results, we show that both methods lead to improvements in the final dose distribution over the traditional robust approach, but differ greatly in their daily dose performance.

<p><b>Abstract:</b></p> 
<p>Bone marrow transplants are frequently used to treat diseases such as blood and bone marrow cancers. To perform a bone marrow transplant, it is necessary to eliminate the patient’s existing bone marrow. In practice, this is most often achieved by irradiating the patient’s entire body – a process known as total body irradiation (TBI) – which frequently results in radiation related side effects. A safer alternative to TBI is total marrow irradiation (TMI), which is concerned with irradiating the bone marrow and avoiding healthy tissue as much as possible.</p>
<p>In prior work, we considered the possibility of using intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for the purpose of TMI and specifically, we developed algorithms to solve a fundamental problem in IMRT treatment planning known as the beam orientation optimization (BOO) problem. In this study, we consider the fluence map optimization (FMO) problem which is at the heart of the BOO problem and consider several methods of improving FMO solution speed and quality. In particular, we consider different line search strategies for the projected gradient algorithm which solves the FMO problem, different warm-start techniques for speeding up FMO evaluation in a BOO setting, and algorithms for parallelized objective function and gradient evaluation to improve the speed of FMO when a large number of beams is used.</p>
<p>We present results from our tests of different line search strategies and different warm start methods. We also report results from using our parallelism enhanced FMO algorithm to solve the FMO problem with 396 beams. We discuss the quality of the different line search and warm start methods; we also discuss the quality of the 30-beam solutions we studied in this and prior work and the limitations of using IMRT for TMI. We conclude by identifying some interesting questions for future research.</p>
